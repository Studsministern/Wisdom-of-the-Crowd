# Wisdom-of-the-Crowd
Project created with PyCharm

Applying the concept of "Wisdom of the Crowd" on a Facebook comment section. This is done to find the average response to guessing competitions which should, in theory, be extremely close to the correct answer. 

The comments are added manually, by inspecting the website and copying the HTML code. The code is then used in combination with BeautifulSoup to find each answer. This is done to not interfere with the Facebook web scraping rules.
